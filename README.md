Explorations in machine learning

Next Step:

Simulate games of Pig and "Learn" based on the outcomes to beat various skilled players over N matches:


- Code Cleanup and refactor, Look for better ways to implement this
(Could maybe pass in a lamda that determines the conditions for roll/don't roll and could eliminate the virtual player)

- Come up with some smarter players (ones with some more complex strategies) but don't waste to much time on this it's the learner that is important. 

- Create a learner that will learn strategies to beat the various players that I have implemented (This part is a bit foggy for me, but I will clarify it more once we the other stuff is implemented)
